My uncle Sonny started compiling this family tree of the Carins back when I was a child. Recently I added the Alonso, Osorio, Villhermosa families to the tree. Renelle provided Grandma Fredding's notes on the Osorio family tree. The text file is in java script object notation (JSON). I added it to GitHub so it can be maintained by anyone for many generations in the future.


Origin of Carin Family from [www.carinclan.com](http://www.carinclan.com)
We have been told that Tata Patricio ”Etyong” Carin came from Spain.

We searched further on the other side of the globe and that is Mexico with the timeframe during 1700 to 1800. We found lots of Carin family records in Mexico too. We did more digging to gather some facts about our forefather. We tried to search more about our ancestors. We found some records in Philippines registrar of birth, marriages and death, but because we do not have the exact dates and some names were recorded only by nicknames, we cannot find some of the records of our ancestors to support our data.

This is our Carin Clan records, so if anyone who can help us furnish more records of our roots, please don’t hesitate to do it. Your help is highly appreciated,

There is a interesting story about the two brothers Cariño (Original Carin name). We only know the first name of one of them, Patricio. He is the forefather to the Carin Clan. The other disapeared in Argao area, there's no information about that brother. These 2 brothers were spotted by the police somewhere north of Argao At that time the police chased Spanish people, after the occupation. it is told by our great great grand father, that they ran away to escape, and that one of them went to Argao and that there's no trace of him after that. The other (Patricio) continued to Dalaguete. He changed his last name to Carin, to avoid the the police to find him by his name. From there he must have found a spot, hiding up in the heights of Lanao area and found his wife Pelacia. From there the Carin Family was started.

This website is dedicated to Carin Family, and to our beloved father Pacifico Carin Sr., nickname Paci, from Narciso Esoy generation and to our beloved Ingko Angel Carin, known as Angel Kikay, from Casimero Meroy generation, who started to trace the Carin Roots. They recorded data by their bare hands, papers and pencils. We still have the copy of this ” UMAT ” in handwriting.

According to the history, the Spanish colonization in 1565 prompted the establishment of Spanish rule over the Philippines that lasted for about 333 years. Spanish people came mainly from Mexico and Spain, and the Philippines was ruled as part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, with its capital in Mexico City. When Mexico became independent in 1821, the Philippines was automatically governed directly from Spain. The Hispanics who sailed from Mexico and Spain to the Philippines was government officials, soldiers, priest, settlers, traders, sailors and adventurers in the year between 1565 and1815. The arrival of the Spanish stops the spread of Islam and intermarriage was accepted and practiced.

Now you can track and trace your, and previous, generation in this website. If you have any correction of the record, or if you cannot find any of your generation in this website, please send your message through Facebook to Carin Clan Group.

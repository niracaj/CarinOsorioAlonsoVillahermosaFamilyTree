My uncle Sonny started compiling this family tree of the Carins back when I was a child. Recently I added the Alonso, Osorio, Villhermosa families to the tree. Renelle provided Grandma Fredding's notes on the Osorio family tree. The text file is in java script object notation (JSON). I added it to GitHub so it can be maintained by anyone for many generations in the future.
